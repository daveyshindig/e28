## Improvements based on P3 peer review feedback


## Outside resources
I used the W3 JavaScript reference; the official docs for Cypress, Chai, and Vuex; and a help thread or two on the various libraries' Github issues and Stack Overflow came in handy. In particular:
- https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/136#issuecomment-525994895
- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49943140/validating-form-inside-a-modal-with-vuelidate-and-bootstrap-vue

## Notes for instructor
#### Testing Notes
E2E and unit tests ensure that:
- the home page loads mix content
- the individual mixes are playable
- navigation links go where they should
- favorites can be added, removed and displayed
- the about page renders
