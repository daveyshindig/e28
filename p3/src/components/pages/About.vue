        <p>808 MIX is a radio show and podcast series, showcasing the talents of local DJs as well as those who visit Hawaiʻi. You can listen to it live on KTUH every Friday night from 6 p.m. to 9 p.m., or via the web at the show's podcast page.</p>
        <p>The show is hosted by Davey Shindig. It was born in June of 2012 out of a love for the many local DJs who work and play in Hawaiʻi, with the aim of serving listeners as a standard-bearer of DJ culture in the islands and beyond our shores.</p>
